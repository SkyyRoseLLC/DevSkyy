Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it.

### 2. Report Privately

Send a detailed report to: **security@skyyrose.com**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 3. Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial response acknowledging receipt
- **72 hours**: Assessment and severity classification
- **7-30 days**: Fix development and testing (depending on severity)
- **After fix**: Coordinated disclosure

### 4. Security Rewards

We appreciate responsible disclosure. Valid security reports may be eligible for:
- Acknowledgment in security advisories
- Recognition in our Hall of Fame
- Monetary rewards (case-by-case basis)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys or credentials
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files (not tracked by git)
3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merge
5. **Testing**: Include security tests in test suite

### For Deployments

1. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Environment Variables**: Set all required environment variables
3. **Database Security**: Use strong passwords and restrict access
4. **Rate Limiting**: Enable rate limiting for APIs
5. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and alerts
6. **Backups**: Regular encrypted backups
7. **Updates**: Keep system and dependencies updated

### Configuration Checklist

```bash
# Required environment variables for production
✓ SECRET_KEY - Strong random key
✓ JWT_SECRET_KEY - Different from SECRET_KEY
✓ MONGODB_URI - Secure connection string
✓ CORS_ORIGINS - Whitelist specific domains
✓ RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED - Set to true
✓ SSL_CERT_PATH - Valid SSL certificate
✓ LOG_LEVEL - Set to INFO or WARNING
```
