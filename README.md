## FastAPI Server
The agent workflow is exposed through a FastAPI application in main.py. The /run endpoint triggers a scan, applies fixes, commits them, and schedules the next run.

## Running
Start the server locally with:

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

On Replit, the included .replit file runs this command automatically.
