All notable changes to SkyyRose Flagship 2 are documented here.

## Unreleased — Home critical rendering repair — 2026-09-07

- Home inlines a source-derived structural critical contract
  (`assets/css/critical/home.min.css`, 15.8 KB, budget 16 KB) at `wp_head` so
  the header, hero stage, first-view typography, primary controls, concierge
  stage and rotating-mark container have their geometry before any external
  stylesheet arrives; independent of optimizer-generated critical CSS.
- Home prints the unchanged hero controller inline directly after the hero,
  ignored by script deferral, and drops its footer copy on the front page only;
  collection routes keep the enqueued controller.
- Home preloads the four first-view faces (Archivo, Hanken Grotesk, Anton,
  Cinzel) with hrefs equal to the `@font-face` URLs.
- New gates: `npm run check:critical`, `scripts/test-critical-rendering.php`,
  `tools/v2-runtime/verify-home-derived-output.mjs`,
  `tools/v2-runtime/measure-home-critical.mjs`,
  `tools/v2-runtime/verify-home-policies.mjs`.

## Unreleased local V2 completion candidate — 2026-09-06

- Preserved approved hero, nine-scene, paid-card and character source assets.
- Scoped content and native Woo layout CSS to the routes that need them.
- Completed cart subtotal/extension hooks, touch controls and native error semantics.
- Repaired invalid spacing tokens, Account/Checkout/Cart shell spacing and long Search/About text reflow.
- Completed localized Skyy loading/failure states and the portrait-to-canvas handoff.
- Archived unreachable page drafts and excluded two protected authoring videos from distribution.
- Added native cart/notice and spacing regressions plus Chromium/WebKit route evidence.
- This candidate is local; mobile performance and production/founder release gates remain explicit.
