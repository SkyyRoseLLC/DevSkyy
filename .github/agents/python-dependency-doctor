Purpose: Triage missing Python dependencies (such as FastAPI) and update requirement files consistently.

Typical trigger:`/agent run python-dependency-doctor` comment or manual workflow dispatch.

Workflow summary:
  1. Install project dependencies.
  2. Reproduce the failing pytest node to capture the stack trace.
  3. Patch the relevant requirements files with the missing dependency pin.
  4. Re-run pytest to confirm the ModuleNotFoundError has been resolved.
