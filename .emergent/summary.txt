<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and developed a comprehensive AI agent management application, evolving it from basic scaffolding to a feature-rich MVP. The process involved meticulous codebase exploration, environment setup, and incremental feature development for both backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React with Vite and Tailwind CSS). Key decisions included adhering to specific URL/port rules, using environment variables, and prioritizing agent enhancements. Challenges like Pydantic version issues, frontend compilation errors, and Vite proxy configuration were systematically debugged and resolved. The work concluded with the creation of new specialized agents and the commencement of an agent assignment system.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an application to display automated agents, their job titles, recent/upcoming jobs, and website health/functionality. It should include a risk-prioritized to-do list for fixes. Agents are to be depicted as little avatars or mini fashion gurus with rose gold, gold, silver, black, and white styling, demonstrating knowledge of pros/cons for tasks. They must be WordPress/WooCommerce/Divi5 experts capable of fixing various code issues (CSS, JSON, HTML, PIP, module, theme builds), finishing unfinished coding to match brand, and enhancing untested skills. The system needs inter-agent communication, with tasks prioritized, logged, and automating risk-reducing improvements. Further enhancements included adding e-commerce agents, making the Performance Agent a universal web development guru for any coding language, implementing integration funnels for website/social media/banking, and evolving the Financial Agent into a comprehensive tax/credit advisor. The latest request also included the ability to assign agents to frontend beauty tasks, and implement social media, email, and SMS automation and design features.

The application currently features a comprehensive AI agent management dashboard with a luxury fashion-themed UI (rose gold, gold, silver). The backend is built with FastAPI, integrating multiple specialized AI agents. The frontend is a React application using Vite and Tailwind CSS.

**Key functionalities implemented so far:**
-   **Agent Gallery Dashboard**: Displays 10 AI fashion guru agents with their health scores, current focus, active/completed tasks. Includes Brand Oracle, Digital Asset Curator, Luxury Commerce Strategist, SEO Marketing Agent, Customer Service Agent, Security Agent, and Performance Agent.
-   **Task Atelier**: A task management interface enabling creation, priority-based filtering, and risk assessment for tasks, with a comprehensive task card view.
-   **Risk Protection Suite**: A dashboard for overall risk status, categorized risks (Brand Security, Site Performance, Financial Operations), and automated response systems.
-   **Universal Web Development Guru (Performance Agent)**: Enhanced to analyze code across 20+ languages, debug errors, detect code smells, identify security vulnerabilities, and suggest optimizations.
-   **Enhanced Financial Agent**: Provides tax preparation services, business credit advisory, and financial health monitoring, integrating with financial platforms.
-   **Integration Hub**: Allows connecting external services (websites, social media, banking, payment processors, etc.) to the agents, with API endpoints for listing and creating integrations.
-   **Environment Configuration**: Robust handling of environment variables for backend () and frontend (), ensuring proper CORS and API routing.
-   **Vite Configuration**: Updated to correctly proxy API calls to the backend and allow access from preview deployment domains.
