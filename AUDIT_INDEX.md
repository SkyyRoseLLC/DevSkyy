## Key Findings

### Most Critical Issues
1. **Custom Password Hasher (CRITICAL)**
   - File: `/security/encryption.py` lines 284-304
   - Issue: Custom SHA256 implementation instead of passlib
   - Risk: Password compromise in breach
   - Fix: Delete class, use passlib only

2. **Unspecified Versions (CRITICAL)**
   - File: `/pyproject.toml` lines 25-41
   - Issue: Uses >= instead of == for versions
   - Risk: Untested dependency versions
   - Fix: Pin to exact versions matching requirements.txt

3. **Bare Exception Handlers (HIGH)**
   - File: `/api/v1/agents.py` 20+ instances
   - Issue: Generic catch-all exceptions
   - Risk: Information disclosure, poor error handling
   - Fix: Catch specific exceptions, return appropriate HTTP codes

### Most Cited Standards Missing
- **RFC 7519** - JWT specification (3 violations)
- **NIST SP 800-38D** - AES-GCM specification (4 violations)
- **NIST SP 800-132** - PBKDF2 specification (3 violations)
- **OWASP Password Storage** - Password hashing best practices (1 violation)
- **Microsoft REST API Guidelines** - API design (2 violations)
