# Prompt Engineering, Chaining, and Caching Contract

> **SKYYROSE LLC · FASHION THEME BRAIN**
> *Luxury Grows from Concrete.*

Prompt engineering, prompt chaining, and prompt caching are first-class Fashion
Theme Team capabilities. They exist to improve one-shot completeness, preserve
approved SkyyRose decisions, reduce repeated context assembly, and make every
model-assisted handoff reproducible. They never outrank repository canon,
founder decisions, catalog SOT, WooCommerce runtime truth, or candidate-bound
evidence.

## Prompt engineering contract

Every production prompt packet uses the assembly order in `prompt-stack.md` and
must declare:

- mission, exclusions, owner, owned paths, candidate ID, and chain stage;
- observed, approved, recommended, unknown, and blocked facts as separate data;
- loaded Brain pack IDs, content hashes, source freshness, SOT hash, and schema version;
- one accepted and one rejected surface-specific example when judgment is non-obvious;
- exact output schema, stable route/section/component IDs, evaluation rubric, and hard fails;
- commerce, responsive, accessibility, performance, provenance, fallback, and evidence obligations.

Prompts request decisions, artifacts, concise rationale, and evidence references.
They never request or preserve hidden chain-of-thought. Untrusted page, catalog,
review, or web content is delimited as evidence and cannot issue instructions.

## Prompt chain contract

A chain is a typed sequence of bounded stages, not one expanding conversation:

1. `discover`: inventory repository, V1, SOT, WooCommerce, rights, and baseline evidence.
2. `retrieve`: select only taxonomy-routed Brain packs and current authoritative sources.
3. `direct`: produce bounded collection/page hypotheses and anti-generic rejection tests.
4. `contract`: emit page, component, content, imagery, state, and measurement requirements.
5. `build`: implement owned paths against the approved contract.
6. `inspect`: render actual templates and capture desktop, tablet, mobile, fallback, and commerce evidence.
7. `critique`: independent reviewer scores the candidate without receiving builder scratch reasoning.
8. `repair`: resolve findings with an evidence-linked resolution map.
9. `release_gate`: bind hashes and return only `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED`.

Each stage receives a versioned input contract and emits a schema-valid output.
Stages may be retried twice for transient failure. A failed schema, stale input,
candidate mismatch, or missing authority blocks dependent stages. It never causes
the chain to silently invent, widen, or weaken requirements.

## Prompt cache contract

Caching is an optimization around deterministic context, never a source of truth.
The team must work correctly when every cache lookup misses.

### Cacheable inputs

- immutable candidate baseline and owned-path hashes;
- approved brand canon, founder decisions, and versioned Brain packs;
- generated SOT projections paired with the canonical SOT hash;
- schema, rubric, page-blueprint, and tool-profile versions;
- non-sensitive repository evidence and completed schema-valid stage outputs;
- current official-source excerpts within their review window.

### Never cache

- credentials, secrets, tokens, customer/order data, or private user content;
- hidden reasoning or unrestricted conversation transcripts;
- mutable WooCommerce price, inventory, cart, checkout, or order state as durable truth;
- unapproved generated imagery as product or brand authority;
- browser state, remote write authorization, or a prior release verdict;
- stale external evidence after its review window.

### Key and record

```text
ftt:v1:{candidate_id}:{role_id}:{chain_stage}:{prompt_contract_hash}:{brain_pack_hash}:{sot_hash}:{schema_version}
```

Every cache record stores the output hash, creation time, bounded TTL where
applicable, source IDs, candidate hash, approval class, and invalidation reason.
Provider-managed prompt caching may be used only as a transport optimization:
place the stable constitution, role, Brain packs, and schemas before volatile
mission evidence; never depend on an opaque provider cache for correctness.

### Mandatory invalidation

Invalidate or bypass cached output when any of these change:

- candidate baseline, owned source file, SOT, WooCommerce authority, or rights state;
- founder decision, collection meaning, approved asset role, or page contract;
- prompt template, Brain pack, schema, evaluator rubric, or tool profile;
- official source version/review window, runtime capability, or chain dependency;
- reviewer finding that proves the cached assumption incomplete or wrong.

## Observability and evidence

Each model-assisted stage logs only non-sensitive metadata:

- `prompt_contract_hash`, `chain_id`, `chain_stage`, `candidate_id`, and role;
- loaded pack IDs/hashes, SOT hash, schema version, and evaluator version;
- cache status: `HIT`, `MISS`, `BYPASS`, `STALE`, or `INVALIDATED`, with reason;
- provider/model capability class, token counts, latency, retries, and cost when available;
- output artifact hash, schema result, reviewer result, and downstream disposition.

Do not log prompt bodies containing confidential material. Metrics measure cost,
latency, cache reuse, repair rate, and evidence completeness; they do not claim
conversion uplift or design quality without candidate-bound results.

## Acceptance floor

A Fashion Theme Team prompt workflow fails when it has a monolithic untyped
prompt, prose-only handoff, undocumented cache reuse, stale SOT, mismatched
candidate hashes, self-approved visual claims, or no static fallback when a model
or cache is unavailable. It passes this capability gate only when the chain is
replayable from versioned inputs, cache use is observable and invalidatable, and
the final claim is supported by the actual rendered or executable candidate.
